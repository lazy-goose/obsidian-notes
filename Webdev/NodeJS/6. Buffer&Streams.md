Buffer <- place for storing portion of a raw data (chunk) outside of V8 heap
Stream <- a sequence of data being moved from one point to the other over time

Streams:
  - readable
  - writable
  - duplex
  - transform (zip)

```js
	const fs = require('fs')

	const readStream = fs.createReadStream('/path/to/file1')
	const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('/path/to/file2')
	readStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
		console.log(chunk) // buffer
		console.log(chunk.toString()) // string
		// ------------------------------------
		writeStream.write(chunk)
	})

	const hadnleError = () => {
		console.log('Error')
		readStream.destroy()
		writeStream.end('Finished with error...')
	}

	readStream.pipe(writeStream)
```

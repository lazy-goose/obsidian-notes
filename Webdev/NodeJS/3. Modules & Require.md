Module development:

module -> file (with share functionality) -> logical part with encapsulated logic ->  like classes can be reused, extended, test

//import
const mod = require('./test')

// export 
module.exports = 'string' | {

}

NodeJS features:
  - global objects
  - modules

---

const os = require('os')

os.platform()
os.release()

---

MODULES ARE NOT FULLY ENCAPSULATED
CLOSURE IS SHARED BETWEEN IMPORTS
